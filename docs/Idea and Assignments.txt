Our final project idea is to create a website where the user inputs a list of stocks they are interested in. The website will periodically pull stock data from a stock api, ensuring validity and current prices, etc. Then pull news about that stock from a news api. Finally the news will be passed through GPT api for sentiment analysis. We will use this to quantify data into good news or bad news. Then we can generate a rough stock prediction of rise or fall using the news data and GPT. We were thinking of using a service like Twillo to notify users through text messages in real time, alternatively, we can just send a notification through the browser.
